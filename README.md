# 🌱 LUIS V2 – Frontend

The frontend of **LUIS V2** (Air Quality Information System V2) provides a web-based application that makes air quality data from the Environmental Office of Styria accessible, analyzable, and exportable.

## 🚀 Project Goal

The aim is to offer a user-friendly platform that processes local air quality data (e.g., particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) from the region of Styria and makes it available in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) – for data analysts, environmental authorities, educators, and the general public.
